# conditional statements in python

# conditional statements are used to make decisions
# there are three types of conditional statements
# 1. if statement   
# 2. elif statement
# 3. else statement
#4. if-elif-else statement
#5. nested if-elif-else statement
# 6. if -else -elif statement

# simple if elif else statement use 

# name=input("enter your name : ")
# if name=="Anees":
#     print("welcome sir")

# # elif name!="Anees":
# #     print("hi")
# else:
#     print("good bye")

# nested conditional statement


# short hand if else statement

# a=int(input("enter a number : "))
# b=int(input("enter another number : "))
# print(a,"  is greater ") if a>b else print("both are equal")if a==b  else print(b," is greater ") 





# match case statement in python

# match case statement is used to compare the value of a variable with the given values

# we use _ to represent the default case

# name=input("enter name : ")
# match name:
#     case "Anees":
#         print(name," he's an Ai student ")
#     case "ALi":
#         print(name,"he's a virtual assistant")
#     case "Kamran":
#         print(name,"he's a lawyer")
#     case "Zain":
#         print(name,"he's IR officer")
#     case "Samad":
#             print(name," he's an Ai student ")
#     case "tayyab":
#         print(name," he's an Ai student ")
#     case _ :
#         print("hi ",name ,"may i know your profession please ? ")
#         profession=input("enter here : ")
#         print("hello ",profession,  "nice to meet u ")

# # in python we don't use break statement in match case statement
