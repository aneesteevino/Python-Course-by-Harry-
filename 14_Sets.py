#                                    ****sets in python**** 

# sets are the collection of unordered items 
# sets are defined by curly brackets
# sets are mutable(can be changed)
# sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable
# sets do not allow duplicate items
# sets are used to perform different operations like union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, subset, superset, disjoint

# set1={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
# print(set1) # it will print the whole set

# set1={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
# print(set1) # it will not print the duplicate values

# set1={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
# print(1 in set1) # it will check if the element is present in the set or not

# set1={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
# set1.add(11) # it will add the element to the set


# set1={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

# s1={1,2,3}
# s2={4,5,6}
# s1.update(s2) # it will add the elements of s2 to s1
# print(s1)

# symetric difference = (A-B) U (B-A) iska hai jo common elements hain unko chor k baqi elements ko print krta hai
